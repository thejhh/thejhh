Most of my projects are under [the Sendanor company](https://github.com/sendanor).

Iâ€™m currently working on few projects -- which are yet to be published. These are web based dashboard apps [Chat gateway](https://viesti.app) and [Form builder](https://lomake.app).

For these projects, there's already following repositories: [sendanor/ui](https://github.com/sendanor/ui), [sendanor/discord](https://github.com/sendanor/discord), and [sendanor/typescript](https://github.com/sendanor/typescript).

For my own projects, I can provide commercial support for 8 000 â‚¬/month + VAT.

For other projects, I might be open to work through my company for 12 000 â‚¬/month or 80 â‚¬/hour + VAT.
